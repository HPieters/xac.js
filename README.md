# Xen API Console (XAC)

XAC is a single page web application that allows managing of XenServer(s) from any browser. Currently this is still a prototype and has no usefull features. This will hopefully change in the future. Untill a stable architecture is agreed upon this remains unversioned.

## Running XAC

If you have all the components installed it is a simple as:

`grunt server`

Before you can run grunt you will be required to have installed the following:

- Node
- Node Package Manager
- Ruby (Ruby Gems)
- SASS
- COMPASS
- Bourbon

Use the Node Package Manager to install all the required node_modules.

## Building XAC
