# Xen API Console (XAC)

XAC is a single page web application that allows managing of XenServer(s) from any browser. Currently this is still a prototype and has no usefull features. This will hopefully change in the future. Untill a stable architecture is agreed upon this remains unversioned.

## Testdrive

To testdrive the XAC application please visit [http://hpieters.github.io/xac.js/](http://hpieters.github.io/xac.js/) and press the 'Try XAC today' button.

## Running XAC

If you have all the components installed it is a simple as:

`grunt server`

This will start the application on localhost:9000.

## Building XAC

If you have all the components installed it is a simple as:

`grunt build`

By default the application will build in the 'dist' folder inside the project.

## Prerequisites

xac.js workflow is using [yeoman](yeoman.io). In order to test run the application or to make your own build you are required to have the following on your machine:

- [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/)
- [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/)
- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/)
